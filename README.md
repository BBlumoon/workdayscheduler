# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project's main functionality is to be used to plan out the day. I had to add javascript to the starter code so that it could properly work. The colors of the hours change depending on the user's time and also includes a save button for the user to add on to their schedule. The current date is also shown by the header of the webpage. The project was a little tricky to figure out at first especially for the changing colors, but after some research I was able to more thouroughly understand it.
